---

## **1.4 UI Design Philosophy**

### **1.4.1 Design Principles**
| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fluid & Modern** | Clean, minimal UI elements with soft rounded corners, generous whitespace, and smooth transitions. |
| **Highly Interactive** | Subtle hover effects, micro-animations, and satisfying state transitions — never overwhelming, always purposeful. |
| **Illustration-Driven** | Every key screen (login, signup, dashboards, empty states) features contextual illustrations that make the app feel alive and welcoming. |
| **Dynamic Illustrations** | Illustrations are stored as managed assets via a database-driven system. Super Admins can upload "illustration packs" that instantly refresh the look of the entire app without code deployments. |
| **Inspired by Design Reference** | The `ui_design.png` in `model/` serves as the primary visual reference: soft purple/lavender palette, rounded card UI, dark sidebar with icon navigation, clean typography, data widgets, and calendar integration. |

### **1.4.2 Living UI Illustration System**

**Problem:** Static illustration assets become stale over time. Replacing them requires code changes and redeployment.

**Solution:** A **database-driven illustration management system** where:

1.  **`ui_illustrations` Table** stores metadata for every illustration used across the app.
2.  **Illustration Packs** are groups of images uploaded together and applied as a set.
3.  **Super Admin Dashboard** provides a UI to upload new packs, preview them, and activate them with one click.
4.  **Frontend** fetches the active illustration URLs from the API and renders them dynamically.

#### **How It Works**

```

#### **Database Table: `ui_illustrations`**

| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | BigInt | Primary key |
| `pack_name` | String | Name of the illustration pack (e.g., "Fresh Start 2026") |
| `key` | String | Identifier used in code (e.g., `login_hero`, `signup_welcome`) |
| `url` | String | Public storage URL to the image file |
| `section` | String | App section where used (login, signup, dashboard, errors, empty_states) |
| `is_active` | Boolean | Whether this illustration is currently live |
| `created_by` | FK → users | Super Admin who uploaded it |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | Upload timestamp |

**Uniqueness:** `(key, is_active)` — only one active illustration per key at any time.

#### **Storage Strategy**
- Illustrations are stored in Laravel's `storage/app/public/illustrations/` directory.
- They are symlinked to `public/storage/illustrations/` via `php artisan storage:link`.
- File naming follows the convention: `{pack_name}/{key}.{ext}` (e.g., `fresh_start_2026/login_hero.svg`).
- Supported formats: SVG (preferred for scalability), PNG, WebP.

#### **API Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/ui/illustrations` | Get all active illustrations | Public |
| `GET` | `/api/ui/illustrations/active/{section}` | Get active illustrations for a section | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/ui/illustrations/packs` | Upload a new illustration pack | Super Admin |
| `PUT` | `/api/ui/illustrations/packs/{id}/activate` | Activate a pack | Super Admin |
| `GET` | `/api/ui/illustrations/packs` | List all uploaded packs | Super Admin |
| `DELETE` | `/api/ui/illustrations/packs/{id}` | Delete a pack | Super Admin |

#### **Frontend Integration**
```jsx
// Illustrations are fetched once at app boot and cached in React Context
const { illustrations } = useIllustrations();

// Usage in any component
<img
  src={illustrations.login_hero}
  alt="Welcome to vDeskconnect"
  className="illustration-fade-in"
/>
```

#### **Animation Guidelines**
| Animation | Duration | Easing | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fade In** | 400ms | ease-out | Page load, illustration transitions |
| **Slide Up** | 300ms | ease-out | Cards appearing, form steps |
| **Scale Pulse** | 200ms | ease-in-out | Button hover, icon hover |
| **Smooth Transition** | 250ms | ease | All interactive state changes |

### **1.4.3 Color Palette (Inspired by ui_design.png)**

| Token | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `primary` | `#7C6BC4` | Primary actions, active states, brand |
| `primary-light` | `#A99DDB` | Hover states, secondary accents |
| `primary-dark` | `#5E4FA2` | Pressed states, emphasis |
| `bg-main` | `#F0EEF7` | Main app background |
| `bg-card` | `#FFFFFF` | Card backgrounds |
| `sidebar` | `#1A1A2E` | Dark sidebar |
| `text-primary` | `#2D2B55` | Primary text |
| `text-secondary` | `#6B6B8D` | Secondary text, labels |
| `text-muted` | `#9B9BB4` | Disabled, placeholders |
| `border` | `#E5E4F0` | Borders, dividers |
| `success` | `#34D399` | Success states |
| `warning` | `#FBBF24` | Warning states |
| `error` | `#EF4444` | Error states |
| `info` | `#60A5FA` | Info states |

### **1.4.4 Component Styling Conventions**
- **Border Radius:** `12px` (cards), `16px` (large panels), `8px` (buttons/inputs), `24px` (hero panels)
- **Shadows:** Soft, diffused shadows — `0 4px 24px rgba(124, 107, 196, 0.08)`
- **Typography:** System font stack with clean, readable sizing hierarchy
- **Spacing:** 8px base unit (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
- **Transitions:** All interactive elements have `transition-all duration-250 ease`

### **1.4.5 Liquid Glassmorphic Background Design System**

**Purpose:** When illustrations are used as **background images** (not standalone `<img>` elements), the UI overlay should implement a **Liquid Glassmorphic** design that creates depth, transparency, and a modern frosted-glass aesthetic. This is especially critical for hero sections like the Welcome Page.

**When to Use:**
- Welcome/Landing page backgrounds
- Auth page backgrounds (login, signup, forgot password)
- Dashboard hero backgrounds
- Any full-page or full-section background image where UI elements sit on top

**Core Principles:**

1. **Background Image Layer (Bottom)**
   - Realistic, high-quality photographic or photorealistic image
   - Slightly desaturated or with a subtle color overlay (20-30% opacity) to ensure text readability
   - Fixed positioning (`background-attachment: fixed` or `position: fixed`) for parallax-like effect
   - Full viewport coverage (`min-height: 100vh`, `width: 100%`, `object-fit: cover` or `background-size: cover`)

2. **Glassmorphic Overlay Layer (Middle)**
   - Semi-transparent panels with backdrop blur effect
   - CSS: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(180%)`
   - Background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` (light theme)
   - Background: `rgba(26, 26, 46, 0.4)` to `rgba(26, 26, 46, 0.6)` (dark sidebar theme)
   - Subtle border: `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18)` or `rgba(124, 107, 196, 0.3)`
   - Soft inner shadow for depth: `box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`

3. **Content Layer (Top)**
   - Clean, high-contrast text (white on dark overlays, dark on light overlays)
   - Glassmorphic cards/containers with enhanced blur
   - CSS: `backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(200%)`
   - Background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)` to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)`
   - Border: `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)`
   - Border radius: `16px` to `24px` for hero panels
   - Shadow: `0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)` for elevation

**Implementation Example (Welcome Page):**

```jsx
// Background layer
<div className="fixed inset-0 -z-10">
  <img
    src={illustrations.welcome_hero}
    alt=""
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    aria-hidden="true"
  />
  {/* Color overlay for readability */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/30 via-primary-dark/20 to-bg-main/40" />
</div>

// Glassmorphic content container
<div className="relative z-10 backdrop-blur-xl bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-hero shadow-elevated p-12">
  <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-white drop-shadow-lg">
    Welcome to vDeskconnect
  </h1>
  <p className="text-lg text-white/90 mt-4">
    Empowering education worldwide
  </p>
</div>
```

**Tailwind Custom Classes:**
Add to `tailwind.config.cjs`:
```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    backdropBlur: {
      'glass': '12px',
      'glass-xl': '16px',
    },
    backgroundColor: {
      'glass': 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)',
      'glass-light': 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)',
      'glass-dark': 'rgba(26, 26, 46, 0.4)',
    },
    borderColor: {
      'glass': 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18)',
      'glass-primary': 'rgba(124, 107, 196, 0.3)',
    },
    boxShadow: {
      'glass': '0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
      'glass-elevated': '0 12px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',
    },
  }
}
```

**Usage Pattern:**
```jsx
// Glass card on background image
<div className="backdrop-blur-glass bg-glass border border-glass shadow-glass rounded-card p-6">
  {content}
</div>
```

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Always ensure **WCAG AA contrast ratios** (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Provide **sufficient overlay opacity** to maintain readability regardless of background image brightness
- Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative background images
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable backdrop animations for users who prefer reduced motion

**Image Guidelines for Backgrounds:**
- **Format:** PNG or WebP (photorealistic, not SVG illustrations)
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1920x1080px for desktop, 768x1366px for mobile variants
- **Style:** Professional, aspirational, modern educational environments
- **Color Harmony:** Should complement the primary purple palette (`#7C6BC4`, `#A99DDB`, `#5E4FA2`)
- **Subject Matter:** Diverse students, modern classrooms, technology in education, global learning
- **Avoid:** Cluttered scenes, overly bright areas that break through overlays, dated aesthetics

### **2.3 User Roles & Hierarchy**

#### **2.3.1 Role Chain (Top → Bottom)**

| Rank | Role | Created By | Can Create | Can Ban/Delete | Exam Writing? | Financial Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Super Admin** | N/A (platform owner) | N/A | N/A | ❌ | Platform-wide analytics only |
| 1 | **School Admin (Director)** | Auth page (signup) | Principal, Admin Staff, Teachers, Students | Everyone below (all ranks) | ❌ | Full — receives financial reports from Receptionist |
| 2 | **Principal** | School Admin | Teachers, Students | Teachers, Students (not Admin Staff, not peers) | ❌ | ❌ Cannot see financial reports from Receptionist |
| 3 | **Admin Staff** | School Admin or Principal | Teachers, Students | Teachers, Students (not peers, not above) | ❌ | ❌ Unless assigned Receptionist role |
| 3a | **Receptionist** *(role assigned to Admin Staff)* | School Admin assigns role | Teachers, Students | Teachers, Students (not peers, not above) | ❌ | ✅ Manages fees, salary announcements, emails parents, feeds financial reports to Admin |
| 4 | **Teacher** | Admin, Principal, Admin Staff, or Receptionist | N/A | ❌ Cannot ban anyone | ❌ **Never writes exams** | ❌ |
| 5 | **Student** | Admin, Principal, Admin Staff, or Receptionist | N/A | ❌ | ✅ **Only role that writes exams** | ❌ |

#### **2.3.2 Super Admin (Platform Owner)**
*   **Identity:** The email address that registered the vDeskConnect platform itself.
*   **Hidden Forever Plan:** Automatically assigned a **"Forever & All Unlocked"** plan upon creating or logging into their admin account. No other plans are shown to them.
*   **Visibility Restrictions:**
    *   ❌ **Cannot** view private school data (students, teachers, exams, grades, finances, etc.).
    *   ✅ **Can** view: Admin user info, brief school bio-data (name, country, plan, active status), advanced charts/widgets/tables, activity statistics (how often schools use the app, login frequency, feature usage per subscription tier).
*   **Dashboard:** Analytics-focused — subscription plan distribution, school activity heatmaps, revenue charts, retention metrics.

#### **2.3.3 School Admin (Director)**
*   **Registration:** The **only** role that can create an account from the **public auth/signup page**. All other users are created **inside the app** by authorized roles.
*   **Free Trial:** Automatically starts a **14-day free trial** upon school registration.
*   **Subscription Plans:** Can choose between **3–4 monthly plans** (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium, Enterprise). All plans expire in 1 month.
*   **Duration Accumulation:** If the admin purchases a plan while on the free trial, the plan's duration is **added to the remaining trial days**. If they purchase another plan before the current one expires, durations stack.
*   **Full Authority:** Can create Principal, Admin Staff (including assigning Receptionist role), Teachers, and Students. Can ban or delete anyone below them.
*   **Deletion with Reason:** When deleting a user account, the Admin **must provide a reason** which is emailed to the user.
*   **Ban Behavior:** Banned users cannot log in. They see a validation error stating the ban reason.

#### **2.3.4 Principal**
*   **Capabilities:** Can perform **most administrative duties** that the School Admin can (build classes, create teachers/students, manage academic settings, generate timetables, etc.).
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   ❌ **Cannot** create Admin Staff or other Principals (only School Admin does this).
    *   ❌ **Cannot** handle financial reports (Receptionist feeds reports only to School Admin).
    *   ❌ **Cannot** ban School Admin or other Principals.

#### **2.3.5 Admin Staff**
*   **Rank:** Above Teachers and Students, below Principal and School Admin.
*   **Capabilities:** Can create Teachers and Students. Can ban users below them (Teachers, Students).
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   ❌ Cannot ban or delete peers (other Admin Staff) or anyone above them.
    *   ❌ Cannot create other Admin Staff or Principals.
    *   ❌ Cannot access financial reports unless assigned the Receptionist role.

#### **2.3.6 Receptionist (Assigned Role)**
*   **Assignment:** A **role tag** assigned to any Admin Staff member by the School Admin. One school can have one or multiple Receptionists.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receives and records school fee payments (cash, bank, online).
    *   Publishes payment/fee announcements and salary announcements to students and teachers.
    *   Emails parents about outstanding fees.
    *   Manages the **Textbook Marketplace** (lists electronic books/literature for student purchase).
    *   Generates financial reports and sends them **directly to the School Admin** (not to Principal or anyone else).
*   **Restrictions:** Same as Admin Staff — cannot ban peers or anyone above.

#### **2.3.7 Teacher**
*   **Academic Role:** Creates lectures, sets exams, grades submissions, writes lesson notes and schemes of work.
*   **Key Restriction:** ❌ **Never writes exams.** Teachers are completely excluded from exam-taking (not even as test subjects).
*   **Restrictions:** Cannot ban anyone. Cannot create other users. Cannot access financial data.

#### **2.3.8 Student**
*   **Learner Role:** Attends lectures, takes exams, views results, purchases textbooks from the marketplace.
*   **Key Privilege:** ✅ **The only role that can write exams.**
*   **Restrictions:** Cannot ban anyone. Cannot create other users. Cannot access admin features.

#### **2.3.9 Account Creation Rules**
*   **Public Auth Page:** **Only** School Admin registration is allowed from the login/signup pages.
*   **Internal User Creation:** All other users (Principal, Admin Staff, Receptionist, Teachers, Students) are created **inside the app** by authorized roles as defined in the hierarchy table above.
*   **First Login — Password Change:** Every user created internally by an Admin/Staff **must change their password on first login.** A full-screen prompt blocks all app access until the password is changed.
*   **No Self-Signup:** Students, Teachers, Admin Staff, and Principals **cannot** create their own accounts from the auth page.

#### **2.3.10 Ban & Delete System**
*   **Ban:** A soft block. The user's account remains but login is denied. The ban reason is displayed as a validation error on the login page.
    *   Any role can ban users **below them** in the hierarchy.
    *   No role can ban peers or anyone above them.
*   **Delete:** Hard removal of the user account.
    *   Only School Admin can delete anyone.
    *   Other roles can only delete users below them.
    *   **Email Notification:** When an account is deleted, the user receives an email with the **reason for deletion** provided by the Admin.
*   **Audit Trail:** All ban/delete actions are logged in the `user_bans` table with `banned_by`, `reason`, `action_type` (ban/delete), and `timestamp`.

#### **2.3.7 Account Creation & Signup Rules**

*   **Public Signup (Auth Page):** **Only** the **School Admin (Director)** can create an account from the login/signup pages. This is the only publicly accessible registration path.
*   **Internal User Creation:** All other users (Principal, Admin Staff, Receptionist, Teachers, Students) are created **inside the app** by authorized roles. Nobody else can self-register.
    *   **School Admin** creates: Principal, Admin Staff (and assigns Receptionist role), and optionally Teachers/Students.
    *   **Principal** creates: Teachers, Students.
    *   **Admin Staff** creates: Teachers, Students.
    *   **Receptionist** creates: Teachers, Students.
*   **First Login — Mandatory Password Change:** Every user created internally by an Admin/Staff **must change their password on first login**. A full-screen modal prompt blocks all app access until the password is changed. This applies to Principal, Admin Staff, Receptionist, Teachers, and Students.
*   **No Self-Service Registration:** Students, Teachers, Admin Staff, and Principals **cannot** create their own accounts. Attempting to access the signup page without valid admin credentials will redirect to login.

#### **2.3.8 Ban & Delete System**

*   **Ban (Soft Block):**
    *   The user's account remains in the database but login is denied.
    *   On the login page, banned users see a **validation error displaying the ban reason** (e.g., *"Your account has been banned. Reason: [admin-provided reason]"*).
    *   Any role can ban users **strictly below them** in the hierarchy.
    *   **No role can ban peers** (e.g., Admin Staff cannot ban other Admin Staff, Teachers cannot ban Teachers).
    *   **No role can ban anyone above them.**
*   **Delete (Hard Removal):**
    *   **School Admin** can delete any user below them (everyone except Super Admin).
    *   **Principal** can delete Teachers and Students only.
    *   **Admin Staff / Receptionist** can delete Teachers and Students only.
    *   **Email Notification on Deletion:** When an account is deleted, the system **automatically sends an email to the deleted user's email address** containing the **reason for deletion** provided by the Admin at deletion time.
*   **Audit Trail:** All ban and delete actions are logged in the `user_bans` table with: `user_id`, `banned_by` (FK to users), `action_type` (`ban`, `delete`), `reason` (text), `timestamp`.
*   **Restoration:** (Future) Banned users can be unbanned by the same or higher-ranking role. Deleted accounts cannot be restored.

#### **2.3.9 Super Admin Visibility Restrictions**

*   **No Private School Data:** The Super Admin **cannot** view:
    *   Student records, grades, exam results, or personal data.
    *   Teacher assignments, lesson notes, or schemes of work.
    *   Financial reports, fee payments, or marketplace sales of individual schools.
    *   Internal messages, notices, or event details of schools.
*   **Allowed Visibility:**
    *   ✅ School Admin user info (name, email, registration date).
    *   ✅ Brief school bio-data (school name, country, timezone, currency, active status).
    *   ✅ Aggregated analytics: subscription plan distribution, total schools, churn rate.
    *   ✅ Activity statistics: how often schools log in, feature usage frequency, app engagement heatmaps.
    *   ✅ Revenue charts, retention metrics, growth trends.

## **3. Database Architecture (SaaS-Ready Model)**

### **3.1 Key Architectural Principles**
1.  **Surrogate Keys:** All tables use `id` (BigInt/UUID). **No composite primary keys.**
2.  **Snake_Case:** All tables and columns are lowercase snake_case (`lesson_notes`, not `Note_Of_Lesson`).
3.  **School Scoping:** Every academic table includes `school_id` for multi-tenancy.
4.  **Configuration-Driven:** Academic structures (terms, grades, subjects) are **admin-configurable**, not hardcoded.
5.  **Polymorphic Resources:** Single `resources` table for PDFs, Videos, Images, Exam Uploads.

## **4. Functional Modules**

### **4.1 Multi-Country Customization Engine**
**Problem:** Nigerian schools use "Terms" (1-3), French schools use "Trimestres" (1-3), American schools use "Semesters" (Fall, Spring).

**Solution:** **JSONB Configuration Column** on `schools` table.

```json
// schools.config (JSONB)
{
  "academic_labels": {
    "grade_label": "Class",
    "term_label": "Term",
    "department_label": "Department"
  },
  "academic_structure": {
    "terms_per_year": 3,
    "term_names": ["Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3"],
    "weeks_per_term": 12,
    "grading_scale": "percentage"
  },
  "exam_settings": {
    "allow_file_upload": true,
    "allowed_file_types": ["png", "jpg", "pdf"],

### **4.2 Exam Engine Module** ⭐ **NEW**

#### **4.2.1 Exam Types**
| Type | Description | Auto-Grade | File Upload |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MCQ** | Multiple Choice Questions | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Theory** | Essay/Short Answer | ❌ No (Manual) | ✅ Yes (PNG, JPG, PDF) |
| **Mixed** | Combination of Both | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes |

#### **4.2.2 Exam Creation — Two Paths**

Teachers can set exams using **two methods**:

**Path A: Manual Exam Creation**
*   Teacher manually adds each question, sets options, marks, and correct answers.
*   Full control over every question.
*   Suitable for custom or highly specific assessments.

**Path B: AI Exam Generator (Static Tools Interface)**
*   Teacher does **NOT** write natural language prompts. Instead, they use a **static tools UI** (dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, number inputs) to define the exam criteria:
    *   **Select Weeks:** Choose which weeks from the Scheme of Work to draw questions from (e.g., Week 1–4, Week 5–8).
    *   **Select Topics:** Choose specific topics within those weeks.
    *   **Question Types:** Toggle OBJ (MCQ), Theory, or Mixed.
    *   **Mark Allocation:** Set total marks or marks per question type.
    *   **Difficulty Level:** Easy / Medium / Hard selector.
    *   **Number of Variants:** Specify how many variant sets to generate (e.g., Variant A, B, C for different classes to prevent cheating).
    *   **Duration:** Set exam time limit.
*   **School AI Service:** Based on these criteria, the school's assigned AI model generates:
    *   OBJ (MCQ) questions with options and correct answers.
    *   Theory questions with model answers.
    *   The requested number of variants (each variant has different questions but same difficulty and topic coverage).
*   **Teacher Review & Edit:** Before publishing, the teacher reviews all AI-generated questions, can edit or remove individual questions, and validates the exam.
*   **Exam Settings:** Title, Subject, Grade Level, Term, Duration, Start/End Time Window.

#### **4.2.3 Exam Flow**
```
1. Teacher Creates Exam (Manual OR AI-Generated via Static Tools)
   ├── Set Title, Subject, Grade Level, Term
   ├── Set Duration (e.g., 60 minutes)

```

#### **4.2.4 Variant System**
*   When the teacher requests **N variants**, the AI generates N distinct question sets covering the same topics and difficulty but with different questions.
*   Variants are assigned to different sections or shuffled among students to prevent collusion.
*   Each variant maintains the same total marks and question count.

#### **4.2.5 Security Features**
*   **Timer Enforcement:** Exam auto-submits when time expires.
*   **File Validation:** Only allowed file types (PNG, JPG, PDF) accepted.

*   **Free Trial:** 14 days for all new schools. Full access during trial period.
*   **Monthly Plans:** All paid plans expire in 1 month.
*   **Duration Accumulation:**
    *   If the admin purchases a plan while still on the free trial, the plan's duration is **added to the remaining trial days**.
    *   If the admin purchases another plan before the current one expires, durations **stack** (remaining days + new plan duration).

*   After changing the password, the user is redirected to their role-specific dashboard.

#### **4.5.5 Ban & Delete System**
*   **Ban (Soft Block):** Account remains but login is denied. User sees a validation error on the login page with the ban reason.
    *   Any role can ban users **strictly below them** in the hierarchy.
    *   **No role can ban peers or anyone above them.**
*   **Delete (Hard Removal):** Account is permanently removed.
    *   **School Admin** can delete anyone below them.

### **4.10 AI-Driven Builder Modules** ⭐ **NEW**

All AI builders use a **Static Tools Interface** — users do NOT write natural language prompts. Instead, they use dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, and number inputs to define criteria. The school's assigned AI model generates content based on these configurations.

#### **4.10.1 Scheme of Work Builder**
*   **Two Paths:**
    *   **Manual Entry:** Admin/Teacher manually enters weeks, topics, and aspects one by one.
    *   **AI Builder (Static Tools):**
        *   **Select Subject:** Dropdown to choose the subject.
        *   **Select Grade Level:** Dropdown to choose the class.
        *   **Select Term:** Dropdown to choose the term.
        *   **Select Weeks:** Number input or range selector (e.g., Week 1–12).
        *   **Select Topics per Week:** Multi-select dropdown of available topics from the curriculum database.
        *   **Select Aspects:** Checkboxes for aspects (objectives, activities, resources, evaluation).
        *   **AI Generates:** The AI produces a complete Scheme of Work with weekly topics, aspects, and objectives based on the selected criteria.
    *   **Validation:** After AI generation, the Admin/Teacher reviews, edits, and validates the Scheme of Work before publishing.

#### **4.10.2 Lesson Note Builder**
*   **Two Paths:**
    *   **Manual Entry:** Teacher manually writes lesson notes section by section.
    *   **AI Builder (Static Tools):**
        *   **Select Scheme of Work:** Dropdown to link to an existing scheme entry.
        *   **Select Week/Topic:** Auto-populated from the linked scheme.
        *   **Select Aspects to Generate:** Checkboxes (objective, content, methodology, evaluation, materials).
        *   **Target Audience Size:** Number input for how many students the lesson is designed for.
        *   **AI Generates:** The AI produces a detailed Lesson Note based on the scheme topic, selected aspects, and audience size.
    *   **Validation:** Teacher reviews, edits, and validates the Lesson Note before publishing.

#### **4.10.3 Lecture Builder**
*   **Two Paths:**
    *   **Manual Assembly:** Teacher manually assembles lecture components.
    *   **AI Builder (Static Tools):**
        *   **Select Subject & Topic:** Dropdowns for subject and topic.
        *   **Generate Walkthrough/Subject:** Toggle to generate the lecture walkthrough using AI or write manually.
        *   **Target Student Count:** Number input for how many students the lecture is for.
        *   **Attachments:** Upload or link PDF documents, video files, or external video links.
        *   **Video Conference Toggle:** If the lecture involves a live video conference, the teacher toggles this on. The conference runs **outside the app** (via Zoom, Google Meet, etc.). The teacher provides the external meeting link.
        *   **Completion Marking:** After the lecture (whether in-person, video-based, or async), the teacher marks the lecture as **complete** inside the app.
    *   **Validation:** Teacher reviews the assembled lecture and publishes it.

#### **4.10.4 Exam AI Generator**
*   Covered in **Section 4.2**. Teachers use static tools to select weeks, topics, criteria, and variant count. AI generates OBJ and Theory questions. Teacher validates and publishes.
