---

## ✅ Phase 1: COMPLETE — Academic Session Configuration

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** (Completed April 10, 2026)

### What Was Built:

#### Backend (Laravel):
1. ✅ **Database Migrations:**
   - `academic_sessions` (updated existing)
   - `academic_terms` (updated with `weeks_count` column)
   - `ca_weeks` (NEW - created 2026_04_10_000001_create_ca_weeks_table.php)
   - `grade_scales` (updated with `is_default` column)

2. ✅ **Models Created:**
   - `AcademicSession.php` - with relationships and scopes
   - `AcademicTerm.php` - with relationships and scopes
   - `CaWeek.php` - with relationships and scopes
   - `GradeScale.php` - with helper method `getGradeForScore()`
   - `GradeLevel.php` - stub model for future use
   - `Subject.php` - stub model for future use
   - Updated `School.php` with all academic relationships

3. ✅ **API Controller:**
   - `AcademicController.php` - comprehensive controller with methods for:
     - Academic Sessions (CRUD + set active)
     - Academic Terms (CRUD + bulk create)
     - CA Weeks (set configuration + summary)
     - Grade Scales (CRUD + set default + preset templates)

4. ✅ **API Routes (19 routes registered):**
   - `/api/academic/sessions` (GET, POST, PUT, PUT set-active)
   - `/api/academic/terms` (GET, POST, POST bulk, PUT, DELETE)
   - `/api/academic/ca-weeks` (GET, GET summary, POST set)
   - `/api/academic/grade-scales` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PUT set-default, GET templates)

#### Frontend (Next.js):
1. ✅ **API Service Layer:**
   - `client/src/lib/academic-api.js` - complete API client with all methods

2. ✅ **Academic Page:**
   - `client/src/app/dashboard/academic/page.jsx` - full-featured page with:
     - **Sessions Tab:** Create session, list sessions, set active session
     - **Terms Tab:** Select session, bulk create terms, single term creation, delete terms
     - **CA Configuration Tab:** Week grid with test/exam toggles, visual summary
     - **Grade Scales Tab:** Create/edit/delete scales, set default, visual grade display

3. ✅ **Navigation Update:**
   - Added "Academic" tab to sidebar with `SlidersHorizontal` icon
   - Positioned after Staff, before Classes

### How to Use:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/academic`
2. **Sessions Tab:** Create an academic session (e.g., "2025-2026")
3. **Terms Tab:** Select the session, bulk create 3 terms (or add individually)

## Phase 2: Grade Levels & Class Structure

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** (Completed April 11, 2026)

**Why First:** Grades/classes are the backbone. Students are assigned to grades, teachers teach grades, exams are per grade.

### 2.1 Grade Levels (aka Classes/Grade Levels)
> **Clarification:** In the architecture, "grade levels" = academic year (JSS1, SS1, Grade 6, 6ème). "Classes" in the sidebar = managing these grade levels + their sections. "Lectures" = actual teaching sessions. They are DIFFERENT.

- [x] **Backend**: Create `grade_levels` table migration
  - Columns: `id`, `school_id`, `name` (e.g., "JSS 1"), `short_name` (e.g., "JSS1"), `order`, `cycle` (e.g., "Junior", "Senior", nullable), timestamps
- [x] **Backend**: API endpoints for grade levels
  - `GET /api/academic/grade-levels` — List all grade levels
  - `POST /api/academic/grade-levels` — Create grade level
  - `PUT /api/academic/grade-levels/{id}` — Update grade level
  - `DELETE /api/academic/grade-levels/{id}` — Delete grade level
  - `POST /api/academic/grade-levels/bulk` — Bulk create grade levels
- [x] **Frontend**: Grade Level Management UI (under Academic tab)
  - "Create Grade Level" card:
    - Input: Name (e.g., "JSS 1")
    - Input: Short Name (e.g., "JSS1")
    - Input: Order (number)
    - Dropdown: Cycle (Junior, Senior, Primary, etc.)
    - Create button
  - Table: Existing grade levels with edit/delete actions
  - Bulk create option: "Create JSS1–JSS3" quick action

### 2.2 Sections (Class Subdivisions)
- [x] **Backend**: Create `sections` table migration
  - Columns: `id`, `school_id`, `grade_level_id` (FK), `name` (e.g., "A", "B", "Yellow"), `room_number`, `capacity`, timestamps
- [x] **Backend**: API endpoints for sections
  - `GET /api/academic/grade-levels/{id}/sections` — List sections
  - `POST /api/academic/sections` — Create section
  - `PUT /api/academic/sections/{id}` — Update section
  - `DELETE /api/academic/sections/{id}` — Delete section
- [x] **Frontend**: Section Management UI (under `/dashboard/classes`)
  - Per grade level: "Add Section" card
    - Input: Section Name (e.g., "A")
    - Input: Room Number
    - Input: Capacity (optional)
    - Dropdown: Assign to Grade Level
    - Save button

  - Multi-step wizard:
    1. Select Grade Level(s) — multi-select (e.g., JSS1, JSS2, JSS3)
    2. Select Subject(s) — multi-select with checkboxes
    3. Toggle: Is Compulsory?
    4. Assign (optional): Department filter
    5. Review & Save

  - `POST /api/ai/scheme-of-work`
  - `POST /api/ai/lesson-note`

  - `POST /api/ai/lecture`
- [ ] Integration with AI provider (OpenAI, Claude, or school-assigned model)
- [ ] Rate limiting & cost tracking per school
- [ ] Prompt templates for each builder type
- [ ] Response parsing & validation

## Notes & Clarifications

### Grade vs Class vs Lecture
- **Grade Level** = Academic year (JSS1, SS1, Grade 6, 6ème). Stored in `grade_levels` table.
- **Class** = In the sidebar, "Classes" is the management page for grade levels + sections + teachers + subjects.
- **Section** = Subdivision of a grade (JSS1-A, JSS1-B). Stored in `sections` table.
- **Lecture** = A teaching session (scheduled class period). Stored in `lectures` table.
- **Scheme of Work** = Curriculum plan for a subject in a grade, broken into weeks with topics and aspects.
- **Lesson Note** = Teacher's detailed guide for a specific week/topic, based on the scheme of work.

### Nigerian School Context
- **Junior Secondary (JSS1–JSS3):** All students take the same core subjects.
- **Senior Secondary (SS1–SS3):** Students take common subjects + departmental subjects (Science, Arts, Commercial).
- **CA (Continuous Assessment):** Aggregate of tests set throughout the term (e.g., 30% of total score).
- **Exam:** Final term exam (e.g., 70% of total score).
- **Total Score = CA + Exam**, then graded using the school's grade scale.

### Academic Session Configuration Flow
1. Admin creates Academic Session (e.g., "2025/2026").
2. Admin configures number of terms (1, 2, or 3).
3. Admin creates Grade Levels (JSS1, JSS2, etc.).
4. Admin creates Subjects.
5. Admin maps Subjects to Grade Levels.
6. Admin configures CA weeks per grade + subject (which weeks have tests, which has exam).
7. Admin assigns Teachers to Subject + Grade.
8. Teachers create Scheme of Work (manual or AI).
9. Teachers create Lesson Notes (manual or AI) based on scheme.
10. Teachers create Lectures (manual or AI).
11. Teachers create Exams/CA Tests (manual or AI).
12. Students take exams, teachers grade.
13. System computes CA aggregate + Exam = Total → Grade → Report Card.

### Marketplace Flow
1. Receptionist/Admin lists textbooks (electronic or physical).
2. Student brows marketplace (filtered by their grade level).
3. Student purchases book → Payment.
4. If electronic: Student downloads book.
5. If physical: Student downloads reference form → Takes form to school office → Collects book.
6. Receptionist tracks orders, inventory, sales analytics.

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm this plan with the user.**
2. **Start with Phase 1 (Academic Session Configuration).**
3. **Each phase should be implemented fully (backend + frontend) before moving to the next.**
4. **Test each phase independently before integrating with other modules.**
5. **Use stubs/mock data for AI endpoints initially; integrate real AI later.**
