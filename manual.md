ðŸ“‹ IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS & BEST PRACTICES:

Critical Points to Maintain:

1. Mobile Overview Logic:
   - Overview section should be hidden on mobile in both sidebar and dashboard
   - Dashboard defaults to 'activity' on mobile  
   - Sidebar removes 'overview' option on mobile

2. Component-Specific Styling:
   - All CSS classes should be prefixed with component name
   - Avoid global styles that might conflict
   - Use BEM methodology for complex components

3. Chart Lifecycle Management:
   - Don't destroy charts during search operations
   - Reinitialize charts only when necessary
   - Preserve chart state during component updates
   - Always destroy charts before recreating on same canvas

4. Route Structure:
   - Use nested routes (/dashboard/*) for main sections
   - Handle route parameters consistently
   - Maintain proper navigation flow between sections

5. Modal State Management:
   - Use proper conditional rendering for modals
   - Implement click-outside-to-close functionality
   - Manage modal state with React state hooks
   - Ensure CSS class names match between JSX and CSS files

6. Search Integration:
   - Preserve component state during search
   - Don't destroy/recreate elements unnecessarily
   - Maintain chart and canvas integrity

7. Performance Considerations:
   - Use useMemo for expensive computations
   - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Use useRef for DOM elements and chart instances

8. CSS Architecture:
   - Each component has its own CSS file
   - Modal component has general modal styles
   - Component-specific modals use component-prefixed styles
   - No style conflicts between components
